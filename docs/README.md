# M-Pesa Analyzer Platform — Engineering Documentation

Welcome to the central engineering documentation hub for the **M-Pesa Analyzer Platform** monorepo. This repository consolidates the PHP CodeIgniter 4 WebApp, the Python FastAPI LLM intelligence microservice, and shared database operations into a unified workspace.

If you only need to run the application using Docker, refer to the root [Operator Guide](../README.md).
